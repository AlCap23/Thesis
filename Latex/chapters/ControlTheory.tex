\chapter{Control Theory}
\label{c:Control}

The following chapter introduces the needed basics of control theory.
In the first section a short introduction to the concepts of Multiple Input Multiple Output Control is 
given and the motivating problem is stated.

The second section deals with the process models and the system identification.

Afterwards the controller design techniques used in this thesis are explained.
Advantages and Disadvantages are given and several examples e.g. the Wood-Berry Destillation Column and Rosebrooks function are used. \par
