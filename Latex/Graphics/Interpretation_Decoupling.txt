P = 50 kW

Normalized Time:
	- shows the difficulty of controlling the pressure 
	- shows slight decrease with increase in the OP
	- maximum at OP = 287 K
	- easy control of temperature

System Dynamics - Pressure
	- similar values around 289 K
	- hence, best decoupling around 290 K
	- strong influence of the Fan to Pressure with OP > 297 K

System Dynamics - Temperature
	- decrease for increase in OP
	- Jump / high increase between 287 and 297 K -> Identification error?
	- Hard decrease --> WHY?
	- Good decoupling

Simulation - T=287 K
	- RGA shows for step in Temperature worse performance than G-Design
	- RGA shows for step in pressure best performance in decoupling
	- G Design performs better at decoupling & rise time
	- Q Decoupling is extremly slow
	- Backs up the interpretation of 289 K -> best decoupling even without the G / Q Algorithm

P = 80 kW

Normalized Time:
	- shows the same behaviour for the process as before
	- the normalized time ratio is better for the pressure coupling

System Dynamics - Pressure
	- best OP around 281 K
	- strong increase in Fan coupling afterwards
	- but better decoupling than P = 50 kW

System Dynamics - Temperature
	- general even decrease -> hence good decoupling for every working point

Simulation - T= 281 K
	- Great performance of the RGA
	- influence from temp to pressure is much more of a problem
	- strong influence of pressure to temperature

Simulatiion - T = 299 K
	- RGA is underdamped
	- G Performance is better in Temperature control!
