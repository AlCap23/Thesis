abstract = {Some analytical results concerning PI controller tuning based on integrator plus time delay models are worked out and presented. A method for obtaining PI controller parameters, K p = $\alpha$ k$\tau$ , and, T i = $\beta$$\tau$ , which ensures a given prescribed maximum time delay error, d$\tau$ max , to time delay, $\tau$ , ratio parameter $\delta$ = d$\tau$ max $\tau$ , is presented. The corner stone in this method, is a method product parameter, ¯ c = $\alpha$$\beta$. Analytical relations between the PI controller parameters, T i , and, K p , and the time delay error parameter, $\delta$, is presented, and we propose the setting, $\beta$ = ¯ c a ($\delta$ + 1), and, $\alpha$ = a $\delta$+1 , which gives, T i = ¯ c a ($\delta$ + 1)$\tau$ , and, K p = a ($\delta$+1)k$\tau$ , where the parameter, a, is constant in the method product parameter, ¯ c = $\alpha$$\beta$. It also turns out that the integral time, T i , is linear in, $\delta$, and the proportional gain, K p , inversely proportional to, $\delta$ + 1. For the original Ziegler Nichols (ZN) method this parameter is approximately, ¯ c = 2.38, and the presented method may e.g., be used to obtain new modified ZN parameters with increased robustness margins, also documented in the paper.},

This contribution deals with the relay based identification of continuous time plants because the knowledge of the controlled system parameters is important for the quality of control. The feedback relay schemes can use different types of relays. This paper is focused on biased relay with hysteresis. The controlled system is identified as a first order transfer function because most of industrial plants can be sufficiently approximated by a first order linear stable system with time delay term. The main aim is to analyze the precision of controlled system parameters identification when the feedback relay parameters will vary. Matlab program environment is used for all simulations conducted in this paper.},

In order to speed up the experiments, simple and short excitations have also been considered.

Paper beschreibt ein neuartiges Verfahren zur entkopplung von MIMO Strecken, welches auf statischer Entkopplung basiert.

Method
-Annahme eines MIMO Systems. 
-Annahme eines PID Reglers mit statischer Entkopplung und Set Point Weight.
- Entkopplung ist Inverse der statischen Verst{\"{a}}rkung ( muss regul{\"{a}}re Matrix sein! )
- Dadurch wird Identity Matrix im Statischen Endwert geschaffen; Nebendiagonale - kleine Abweichungen sind linear zu s bzw. j*w -{\textgreater} Kleine Bandbreite ist gut
- Geschlossener Kreis wird berechnet; Annahmen zum Verlauf und Lage der Polstellen f{\"{u}}hren zur vereinfachten Matrix H, welche das System approximiert
-Interaction Indices: Die Elemente der Nebendiagonalen werden mittels der Sensitivity der beiden Hauptloops beschrieben. Daher kann eine obere Schranke hergeleitet werden, welche direkt mit den Regler in Verbindung gebracht werden kann. Hierbei wird allerdings nur der I Anteil ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt, was zu einer Konstanten f{\"{u}}hrt. HIER KANN DIE BR{\"{U}}CKE ZU DEM IN LUNZE VORGESTELLTEN VERFAHREN GESCHLAGEN WERDEN! Die Interaction, also der Einfluss der Loops aufeinander, ist solange klein wie kI klein ist. Ebenfalls wird hier der Nachteil des Verfahren beschrieben: Durch die Abh{\"{a}}ngigkeiten der Sensitivity der Kreise und kI ist keine Unabh{\"{a}}ngige Stellschraube gegeben.
Weiterhin wird die Bandbreite des geschlossenen Systems hergeleitet. Es wird weiterhin gezeigt, dass die Kopplung ohne Set Point Weighting zunimmt. Diese Sch{\"{a}}tzungen sind konservativ.
- Auslegung des Reglers nun mit Standard Methoden f{\"{u}}r die Eintr{\"{a}}ge der Hauptdiagonalen. Hier werden noch verschiedene Methoden erw{\"{a}}hnt.


Conclusion
Simples Verfahren wurde erfolgreich vorgestellt. Gilt, solange die Kopplung nicht zu hoch ist. Beispiele werden vorgestellt.
Set-Point weighting ist notwendig.
Interaction indices wurden vorgestellt, welche - im Gegensatz zur RGA - den Regler mit einschlie{\ss}en.},

@article{Berner2014a,
abstract = {The relay autotuner for PID control is based on the simple idea of investigating process dynamics by the oscillation obtained when the PID controller is replaced by a relay unction. In this paper an asymmetric relay function is used, which provides an equation for the static gain of the process. A method to find the normalized time delay is proposed and the benefits of this is discussed. Ways to find low-order models from the experiment are described. Considerations of how to choose the relay parameters are made and some examples are given.},

Hier wird im allg. ein Verfahren auf Grundlage der Zustandsraumdarstellung benutzt.
Dazu wird Gegenkopplungsbedingung ( Inverse der Statischen Verst{\"{a}}rkung -{\textgreater} regul{\"{a}}r! ) benutzt um die kI auszulegen.

Einzige Bedingung ist demnach, dass det(KS KI) {\textgreater} 0 ist.

Grunds{\"{a}}tzlich:
KI soll so gew{\"{a}}hlt werden, dass die Pole alle in LHE sind. Dies geschieht durch schrittweise erh{\"{o}}hen des Tuningfaktors a, der letztendlich eine Matrix skaliert und mit ihr KI bildet.
Zun{\"{a}}chst starten alle bei Null, dann weiter bis der Realteil aller Eigenwerte des geschlossenen Kreises kleiner Null ist.
