abstract = {The problem of controlling a system with constant but unknown parameters is considered. The analysis is restricted to discrete time single-input single-output systems. An algorithm obtained by combining a least squares estimator with a minimum variance regulator computed from the estimated model is analysed. The main results are two theorems which characterize the closed loop system obtained under the assumption that the parameter estimates converge. The first theorem states that certain covariances of the output and certain cross-covariances of the control variable and the output will vanish under weak assumptions on the system to be controlled. In the second theorem it is assumed that the system to be controlled is a general linear stochastic nth order system. It is shown that if the parameter estimates converge the control law obtained is in fact the minimum variance control law that could be computed if the parameters of the system were known. This is somewhat surprising since the least squares estimate is biased. Some practical implications of the results are discussed. In particular it is shown that the algorithm can be feasibly implemented on a small process computer. ?? 1973.},

abstract = {This book provides an introduction to the basic principles and tools for the design and analysis of feedback systems. It is intended to serve a diverse audience of scientists and engineers who are interested in understanding and utilizing feedback in physical, biological, information and social systems.We have attempted to keep the mathematical prerequisites to a minimum while being careful not to sacrifice rigor in the process. We have also attempted to make use of examples from a variety of disciplines, illustrating the generality of many of the tools while at the same time showing how they can be applied in specific application domains. A major goal of this book is to present a concise and insightful view of the current knowledge in feedback and control systems. The field of control started by teaching everything that was known at the time and, as new knowledge was acquired, additional courses were developed to cover new techniques. A consequence of this evolution is that introductory courses have remained the same for many years, and it is often necessary to take many individual courses in order to obtain a good perspective on the field. In developing this book, we have attempted to condense the current knowledge by emphasizing fundamental concepts. We believe that it is important to understand why feedback is useful, to know the language and basic mathematics of control and to grasp the key paradigms that have been developed over the past half century. It is also important to be able to solve simple feedback problems using back-of-the-envelope techniques, to recognize fundamental limitations and difficult control problems and to have a feel for available design methods. This book was originally developed for use in an experimental course at Caltech involving students from a wide set of backgrounds. The course was offered to undergraduates at the junior and senior levels in traditional engineering disciplines, as well as first- and second-year graduate students in engineering and science. This latter group included graduate students in biology, computer science and physics. Over the course of several years, the text has been classroom tested at Caltech and at Lund University, and the feedback from many students and colleagues has been incorporated to help improve the readability and accessibility of the material. Because of its intended audience, this book is organized in a slightly unusual fashion compared to many other books on feedback and control. In particular, we introduce a number of concepts in the text that are normally reserved for second-year courses on control and hence often not available to students who are not control systems majors. This has been done at the expense of certain traditional topics, which we felt that the astute student could learn independently and are often explored through the exercises. Examples of topics that we have included are nonlinear dynamics, Lyapunov stability analysis, the matrix exponential, reachability and observability, and fundamental limits of performance and robustness. Topics that we have deemphasized include root locus techniques, lead/lag compensation and detailed rules for generating Bode and Nyquist plots by hand. Several features of the book are designed to facilitate its dual function as a basic engineering text and as an introduction for researchers in natural, information and social sciences. The bulk of the material is intended to be used regardless of the audience and covers the core principles and tools in the analysis and design of feedback systems. Advanced sections, marked by the {\^{a}}€{\oe}dangerous bend{\^{a}}€� symbol shown here, contain material that requires a slightly more technical background, of the sort that would be expected of senior undergraduates in engineering. A few sections are marked by two dangerous bend symbols and are intended for readers with more specialized backgrounds, identified at the beginning of the section. To limit the length of the text, several standard results and extensions are given in the exercises, with appropriate hints toward their solutions. To further augment the printed material contained here, a companion web site has been developed and is available from the publisher{\^{a}}€™s web page: http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8701.html The web site contains a database of frequently asked questions, supplemental examples and exercises, and lecture material for courses based on this text. The material is organized by chapter and includes a summary of the major points in the text as well as links to external resources. The web site also contains the source code for many examples in the book, as well as utilities to implement the techniques described in the text. Most of the code was originally written using MATLAB M-files but was also tested with LabView MathScript to ensure compatibility with both packages. Many files can also be run using other scripting languages such as Octave, SciLab, SysQuake and Xmath. The first half of the book focuses almost exclusively on state space control systems. We begin in Chapter 2 with a description of modeling of physical, biological and information systems using ordinary differential equations and difference equations. Chapter 3 presents a number of examples in some detail, primarily as a reference for problems that will be used throughout the text. Following this, Chapter 4 looks at the dynamic behavior of models, including definitions of stability and more complicated nonlinear behavior. We provide advanced sections in this chapter on Lyapunov stability analysis because we find that it is useful in a broad array of applications and is frequently a topic that is not introduced until later in one{\^{a}}€™s studies. The remaining three chapters of the first half of the book focus on linear systems, beginning with a description of input/output behavior in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we formally introduce feedback systems by demonstrating how state space control laws can be designed. This is followed in Chapter 7 by material on output feedback and estimators. Chapters 6 and 7 introduce the key concepts of reachability and observability, which give tremendous insight into the choice of actuators and sensors, whether for engineered or natural systems. The second half of the book presents material that is often considered to be from the field of {\^{a}}€{\oe}classical control.{\^{a}}€� This includes the transfer function, introduced in Chapter 8, which is a fundamental tool for understanding feedback systems. Using transfer functions, one can begin to analyze the stability of feedback systems using frequency domain analysis, including the ability to reason about the closed loop behavior of a system from its open loop characteristics. This is the subject of Chapter 9, which revolves around the Nyquist stability criterion. In Chapters 10 and 11, we again look at the design problem, focusing first on proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and then on the more general process of loop shaping. PID control is by far the most common design technique in control systems and a useful tool for any student. The chapter on frequency domain design introduces many of the ideas of modern control theory, including the sensitivity function. In Chapter 12, we combine the results from the second half of the book to analyze some of the fundamental trade-offs between robustness and performance. This is also a key chapter illustrating the power of the techniques that have been developed and serving as an introduction for more advanced studies. The book is designed for use in a 10- to 15-week course in feedback systems that provides many of the key concepts needed in a variety of disciplines. For a 10-week course, Chapters 1{\^{a}}€“2, 4{\^{a}}€“6 and 8{\^{a}}€“11 can each be covered in a week{\^{a}}€™s time, with the omission of some topics from the final chapters. A more leisurely course, spread out over 14{\^{a}}€“15 weeks, could cover the entire book, with 2 weeks on modeling (Chapters 2 and 3) {\^{a}}€” particularly for students without much background in ordinary differential equations {\^{a}}€” and 2 weeks on robust performance (Chapter 12). The mathematical prerequisites for the book are modest and in keeping with our goal of providing an introduction that serves a broad audience. We assume familiarity with the basic tools of linear algebra, including matrices, vectors and eigenvalues. These are typically covered in a sophomore-level course on the subject, and the textbooks by Apostol [10], Arnold [13] and Strang [187] can serve as good references. Similarly, we assume basic knowledge of differential equations, including the concepts of homogeneous and particular solutions for linear ordinary differential equations in one variable. Apostol [10] and Boyce and DiPrima [42] cover this material well. Finally, we also make use of complex numbers and functions and, in some of the advanced sections, more detailed concepts in complex variables that are typically covered in a junior-level engineering or physics course in mathematical methods. Apostol [9] or Stewart [186] can be used for the basic material, with Ahlfors [6], Marsden and Hoffman [146] or Saff and Snider [172] being good references for the more advanced material. We have chosen not to include appendices summarizing these various topics since there are a number of good books available. One additional choice that we felt was important was the decision not to rely on a knowledge of Laplace transforms in the book. While their use is by far the most common approach to teaching feedback systems in engineering, many students in the natural and information sciences may lack the necessary mathematical background. Since Laplace transforms are not required in any essential way, we have included them only in an advanced section intended to tie things together for students with that background. Of course, we make tremendous use of transfer functions, which we introduce through the notion of response to exponential inputs,},

abstract = {System Identification shows the student reader how to approach the system identification problem in a systematic fashion. The process is divided into three basic steps: experimental design and data collection; model structure selection and parameter estimation; and model validation, each of which is the subject of one or more parts of the text. Following an introduction on system theory, particularly in relation to model representation and model properties, the book contains four parts covering: data-based identification non-parametric methods for use when prior system knowledge is very limited; time-invariant identification for systems with constant parameters; time-varying systems identification, primarily with recursive estimation techniques; and model validation methods.A fifth part, composed of appendices, covers the various aspects of the underlying mathematics needed to begin using the text.The book uses essentially semi-physical or gray-box modeling methods although data-based, transfer-function system descriptions are also introduced. The approach is problem-based rather than rigorously mathematical. The use of finite input output data is demonstrated for frequency- and time-domain identification in static, dynamic, linear, nonlinear, time-invariant and time-varying systems. Simple examples are used to show readers how to perform and emulate the identification steps involved in various control design methods with more complex illustrations derived from real physical, chemical and biological applications being used to demonstrate the practical applicability of the methods described. End-of-chapter exercises (for which a downloadable instructors Solutions Manual is available from fill in URL here) will both help students to assimilate what they have learned and make the book suitable forself-tuition by practitioners looking to brush up on modern techniques.Graduate and final-year undergraduate students will find this text to be a practical and realistic course in system identification that can be used for assessing the processes of a variety of engineering disciplines. System Identification will help academic instructors teaching control-related to give their students a good understanding of identification methods that can be used in the real world without the encumbrance of undue mathematical detail.},

To increase productivity and efficiency it must be ensured that the control system is used effectively. The best way to do this is to turn the automatic control on and to tune it correctly. This paper describes the expertise in control loop performance monitoring gathered by ABB's control experts. With more automated production processes and fewer experts, control loop performance monitoring (LPM) needs to be able to evaluate one hundred loops at a time instead of loop-by-loop analysis. This cannot be done with training or manual tools. In this paper, ABB's perspective on loop performance monitoring as well as several novel features is described. Finally, further research directions are highlighted.},

abstract = {4., aktualisierte Aufl. 2016 Lizenzpflichtig Thermodynamik kompakt stellt den Lehrstoff der Thermodynamik in kurzer und prägnanter Weise dar. Den Autoren gelingt es, die Sachverhalte inhaltlich auf hohem Niveau, aber gut verständlich zu vermitteln. Die Studierenden lernen so, das Wichtige vom Nebensächlichen zu unterscheiden. Das Buch beschreitet neue Wege in der Präsentation des Stoffes. So werden Bilanzgleichungen allgemein betrachtet, und es wird relativ früh auf das thermische und kalorische Verhalten der Stoffe eingegangen. Das ideale Gas und das reale Gasverhalten werden parallel für verschiedene Anwendungen gezeigt. Zahlreiche Verständnisfragen vertiefen den Stoff. Mehrere Anwendungskapitel runden das Buch ab und verdeutlichen, wozu die theoretischen Gleichungen verwendet werden. 3D-Animationen und weiteres Bildmaterial im Internet dienen der Veranschaulichung. Die Darstellungen der früheren Auflagen haben sich bewährt. Für die vierte Auflage wurden verschiedene Korrekturen durchgeführt, der Text an mehreren Stellen präzisiert und Bilder angepasst. Weiterhin wurden Schreibfehler im Text und in den Gleichungen beseitigt. Der Inhalt Einleitung.- Grundlagen.- Hauptsätze der Thermodynamik.- Stoffe und deren thermodynamische Beschreibung.- Anwendungen der Hauptsätze.- Maximale Arbeit und Exergie.- Technische Anwendungen.

The approach assumes the availability of a dynamic process model which is used to design a proportional output optimal controller.

One is a conventional sub-critical ammonia refrigeration cycle and the other is a trans-critical CO2 refrigeration cycle.

For the ammonia cycle, there are several simple control structures that give self-optimizing control, that is, which achieve in practice close-to-optimal operation with a constant setpoint policy. For the CO2 cycle on the other hand, a combination of measurements is necessary to achieve self-optimizing control. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The controlled system is identified as a first order transfer function because most of industrial plants can be sufficiently approximated by a first order linear stable system with time delay term.

abstract = {This thesis investigates a special type of energy system, namely energy use in supermarkets through modelling, simulations and field studies. A user-friendly computer program, CyberMart, which calculates the total energy performance of a supermarket, is presented. The modelling method described in this thesis has four phases: the first phase is the development of a conceptual model that includes its objectives, the environment and the components of the system, and their interconnections. The second phase is a quantitative model in which the ideas from the conceptual model are transformed into mathematical and physical relationships. The third phase is an evaluation of the model with a sensitivity analysis of its predictions and comparisons between the computer model and results from field measurements. The fourth phase is the model application in which the computer model answers questions identified in the beginning of the modelling process as well as other questions arising throughout the work. Field measurements in seven different supermarkets in Sweden were carried out to: (i) investigate the most important parameters that influence energy performance in supermarkets, (ii) analyse the operation of new system designs with indirect system implementation in Sweden during recent years, and (iii) validate the computer model. A thorough sensitivity analysis shows a total sensitivity of 5.6 {\%}, which is a satisfactory result given a 10{\%} change in the majority of input parameters and assumptions, with the exception of outdoor temperatures and solar radiation that were calculated as extreme values in METEONORM. Comparisons between measurements and simulations in five supermarkets also show a good agreement. Measurements and simulation results for a whole year were not possible due to lack of data. CyberMart opens up perspectives for designers and engineers in the field by providing innovative opportunities for assessment and testing of new energy efficient measures but also for evaluation of different alreadyinstalled system designs and components. The implementation of new energy-saving technologies in supermarkets requires an extensive integrated analysis of the energy performances of the refrigeration system, HVAC system, lighting, equipment, and the total energy usage. This analysis should be done over a long period, to evaluate and compare the real energy performance with the theoretical values calculated by Cyber- Mart.

abstract = {— Most of the modern industries have multivariable processes wherein interactions exist. As the process outputs and inputs are coupled, designing controller for MIMO processes is a challenging task. The effective open-loop transfer functions (EOTFs) between the paired process input-output variables have complex high order dynamics. While many of the decoupling control methods uses effective transfer function (ETF) as an FOPDT approximation for EOTF in order to tune the controllers, their suitability is limited only to certain type of processes. In this paper, wide variety of multivariable processes have been considered and possibility for applicability of methods relying on ETFs for controller design have been explored. Further, a decoupling control method has been proposed which uses simple decoupler elements. The PI/PID controllers are designed in a straightforward manner based on the EOTFs. The proposed method doesn't involve any approximations in form of model order reduction and ensures the realizability of decoupler by simply ignoring the unrealizable functions in the decoupling elements. Simulations have been carried out on various MIMO systems and various performance indices have been evaluated and compared against existing methods to validate our finding and check the robustness of the proposed method for significant plant-model mismatch. Keywords— Multivariable; PI/PID control; decoupling; effective open-loop transfer function (EOTF)},

abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology to design multivariable PID controllers for two-input and two-output systems. The proposed control strategy, which is centralized, combines four PID controllers plus two possible delays and two P controllers. The proportional gains in the P controllers act as tuning parameters in order to modify the behavior of the loops almost independently. The design procedure consists of three steps: first, an ideal decoupler including integral action is determined. Second, the decoupler is approximated with four PID controllers plus two possible delays. Third, the proportional gains are tuned to achieve the specified performance. The proposed method is applied to three representative processes.},

Conventional two point control, whereby the overhead composition is controlled by reflux flow rate and bottom composition by means of steam rate, was demonstrated to be unsatisfactory. Two alternate control systems, namely a noninteracting control system and a ratio control system were evaluated. The noninteracting control system was constructed from a transfer function representation of the distillation column dynamics, determined from a series of on-line pulse tests. The results show that a very significant improvement in the control of both compositions is achieved by using noninteracting control or the ratio control scheme suggested by Rijnsdorp compared to the behavior that results using conventional two point feedback control. However, the control performance obtained using noninteracting control was only marginally better than that using the ratio control scheme. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

@article{Ang2005b,
abstract = {Designing and tuning a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. Usually, initial designs obtained by all means need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired. This stimulates the development of "intelligent" tools that can assist engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system identification and "intelligent" techniques in software based PID systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a useful degree. This should also assist future development of "plug-and-play" PID controllers that are widely applicable and can be set up easily and operate optimally for enhanced productivity, improved quality and reduced maintenance requirements.},

Analytical relations between the PI controller parameters, T i , and, K p , and the time delay error parameter, $\delta$, is presented, and we propose the setting, $\beta$ = ¯ c a ($\delta$ + 1), and, $\alpha$ = a $\delta$+1 , which gives, T i = ¯ c a ($\delta$ + 1)$\tau$ , and, K p = a ($\delta$+1)k$\tau$ , where the parameter, a, is constant in the method product parameter, ¯ c = $\alpha$$\beta$. It also turns out that the integral time, T i , is linear in, $\delta$, and the proportional gain, K p , inversely proportional to, $\delta$ + 1. For the original Ziegler Nichols (ZN) method this parameter is approximately, ¯ c = 2.38, and the presented method may e.g., be used to obtain new modified ZN parameters with increased robustness margins, also documented in the paper.},

annote = {Abstract
Paper beschreibt ein neuartiges Verfahren zur entkopplung von MIMO Strecken, welches auf statischer Entkopplung basiert.

Method
-Annahme eines MIMO Systems. 
-Annahme eines PID Reglers mit statischer Entkopplung und Set Point Weight.
- Entkopplung ist Inverse der statischen Verst{\"{a}}rkung ( muss regul{\"{a}}re Matrix sein! )
- Dadurch wird Identity Matrix im Statischen Endwert geschaffen; Nebendiagonale - kleine Abweichungen sind linear zu s bzw. j*w -{\textgreater} Kleine Bandbreite ist gut
- Geschlossener Kreis wird berechnet; Annahmen zum Verlauf und Lage der Polstellen f{\"{u}}hren zur vereinfachten Matrix H, welche das System approximiert
-Interaction Indices: Die Elemente der Nebendiagonalen werden mittels der Sensitivity der beiden Hauptloops beschrieben. Daher kann eine obere Schranke hergeleitet werden, welche direkt mit den Regler in Verbindung gebracht werden kann. Hierbei wird allerdings nur der I Anteil ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt, was zu einer Konstanten f{\"{u}}hrt. HIER KANN DIE BR{\"{U}}CKE ZU DEM IN LUNZE VORGESTELLTEN VERFAHREN GESCHLAGEN WERDEN! Die Interaction, also der Einfluss der Loops aufeinander, ist solange klein wie kI klein ist. Ebenfalls wird hier der Nachteil des Verfahren beschrieben: Durch die Abh{\"{a}}ngigkeiten der Sensitivity der Kreise und kI ist keine Unabh{\"{a}}ngige Stellschraube gegeben.
Weiterhin wird die Bandbreite des geschlossenen Systems hergeleitet. Es wird weiterhin gezeigt, dass die Kopplung ohne Set Point Weighting zunimmt. Diese Sch{\"{a}}tzungen sind konservativ.
- Auslegung des Reglers nun mit Standard Methoden f{\"{u}}r die Eintr{\"{a}}ge der Hauptdiagonalen. Hier werden noch verschiedene Methoden erw{\"{a}}hnt.


Conclusion
Simples Verfahren wurde erfolgreich vorgestellt. Gilt, solange die Kopplung nicht zu hoch ist. Beispiele werden vorgestellt.
Set-Point weighting ist notwendig.
Interaction indices wurden vorgestellt, welche - im Gegensatz zur RGA - den Regler mit einschlie{\ss}en.},

The first method is a tightening of previously suggested uncertainty bounds for the HIIA. The second method is based on a novel exploration of the relationship between the PM and the area enclosed by the Nyquist diagram. The latter method is a numerical approximation of the analytical bounds of the PM, whilst the former one provides very loose bounds for the examples presented here .},

abstract = {System identification is the art and science of building mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data. It can be seen as the interface between the real world of applications and the mathematical world of control theory and model abstractions. As such, it is an ubiquitous necessity for successful applications. System identification is a very large topic, with different techniques that depend on the character of the models to be estimated: Linear, nonlinear, hybrid, nonparametric, etc. At the same time, the area can be characterized by a small number of leading principles, e.g. to look for sustainable descriptions by proper decisions in the triangle of model complexity, information contents in the data, and effective validation. The area has many facets and there aremany approaches and methods. A tutorial or a survey in a few pages is not quite possible. Instead, this presentation aims at giving an overview of the "science" side, i.e. basic principles and results and at pointing to open problem areas in the practical, "art", side of how to approach and solve a real problem. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Zusammenh{\"{a}}nge. Dabei steht weniger die Konstruktion ausgew{\"{a}}hlter Bauteile im Vorder- grund, sondern vielmehr das Verst{\"{a}}ndnis um die komplexen Wirkzusammenh{\"{a}}nge und die Systemdynamik: Messen – Steuern – Regeln – Antreiben: Keine „Schr{\"{a}}ubchenkunde“ – Beschr{\"{a}}nkung auf die ingenieurgerechte Beschreibung der Wirkmechanismen. Es wird das verallgemeinerte Betriebsverhalten und die Betriebscharakteristik der mechatronischen Kom- ponenten vorgestellt, soweit diese f{\"{u}}r die Anlagenkonfiguration, den Betrieb und die St{\"{o}}rungs- suche hilfreich sein k{\"{o}}nnen (Kap. 4). Konstruktive Details k{\"{o}}nnen den umfangreichen Web- Seiten der Komponentenhersteller entnommen werden; eine Auswahl dazu wird auf der Ver- lagsseite als Online-Service (vgl. Anhang A6) bereitgehalten. Obwohl der Schwerpunkt des Buches wegen der besonderen Bedeutung der Mobilhydraulik auf dem Gebiet der {\"{O}}lhydraulik liegt, wird immer wieder versucht, Parallelen und Differenzen zum Systemverhalten der Pneumatik herauszuarbeiten. Einen besonderen Schwerpunkt bildet dabei die moderne Simulationstechnik (Kap. 5), hier soll eine erkannte L{\"{u}}cke in der deutschsprachigen Fachliteratur geschlossen werden. Die dazu notwendigen mathematischen Grundkenntnisse werden in den vorgenannten Abschnitten kon- sequent gelegt sowie dazu wichtige Randgebiete in den Anh{\"{a}}ngen A1 bis A4 behandelt. An- hand von anschaulichen Beispielen aus der Fluidtechnik wird die Herangehensweise zur L{\"{o}}- sung von interdisziplin{\"{a}}ren dynamischen Problemstellungen vorgestellt. Der Ingenieur erh{\"{a}}lt mit der Simulationstechnik ein Werkzeug, um die Wirkungen von dynamischen Vorg{\"{a}}ngen absch{\"{a}}tzen zu k{\"{o}}nnen, die in der Praxis immer wieder Probleme beim Betrieb von Anlagen und Ger{\"{a}}ten bereiten. Andererseits kann er durch diese Kenntnisse die Ergebnisse von kom- merziellen Softwaretools kritisch hinterfragen – eine fachliche Qualifikation, die zunehmend wichtiger f{\"{u}}r die berufliche Praxis wird.},
